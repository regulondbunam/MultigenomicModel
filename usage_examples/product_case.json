	"note": "The \"<b>ara</b>binose regulator,\" AraC, is a transcription factor that regulates transcription of several genes and operons involved in arabinose catabolism and transport. It coregulates with another transcriptional regulator, CRP; both are transcription factors involved in l-arabinose degradation. These regulators bind cooperatively to activate transcription of five operons related to transport, catabolism, and autoregulation of l-arabinose. Transcription of these operons is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown in the absence of glucose and when the physiological inducer, l-arabinose, binds to the AraC regulator. In the absence of glucose, cellular cyclic AMP levels are high and cyclic AMP forms a dimeric complex with CRP to coregulate with AraC |CITS:[9409145][1744033][6319708][1400237][9600836][2231717][6377308]|.\n\nAraC binds to five target sites in the <i>araB</i>p region. AraC binds to the less-conserved site (-42.5) with less strength; this binding occurs only in the presence of arabinose, and it is absolutely required for expression of <i>araB</i>p |CITS:[2237403][3279415][2962192][3520549][8428590]|. AraC binding to the distal site (-123.5) has been shown to down-regulate expression of <i>araB</i>p and <i>araC</i>p |CITS:[1560456][3279415]|. \n\nIn the absence of arabinose, AraC is unable to activate <i>araB</i>p, but it regulates its own expression by repressing <i>araC</i>p and <i>araB</i>p simultaneously |CITS:[2237403][3279415][3520549]|. Arabinose triggers AraC-dependent activation of <i>araB</i>p and relieves AraC-dependent repression of <i>araC</i>p |CITS:[3279415][3520549]|. The <i>araBAD</i> operon is located upstream of <i>araC</i> and in the opposite direction.\n\nIn the presence of arabinose, this regulator activates transcription by overlapping the -35 box of the core promoters, and the central position of the binding site is located near bp -41.5. The binding targets for AraC consist of 17-nucleotide-long direct repeat sequences that possess conserved motifs; each monomer binds to one of these conserved sequences |CITS:[9409145][8980677]|. \n\nThe AraC regulator belongs to the AraC/XylS family and occurs as both a monomer and a homodimer. It is composed of two domains. The solution structure of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain has been solved. It consists of two helix-turn-helix regions connected by an &alpha;-helix |CITS:[19422057]|. The N-terminal domain is responsible for dimerization and L-arabinose binding |CITS:[9409145][8451183]|. A new domain, between the dimerization domain and DNA-binding domains of the dimeric AraC protein, facilitates repression of the <i>araBAD</i> operon by AraC in the absence of arabinose |CITS:[22383259]|. Its crystal structure |CITS:[9367758][9103202]| reveals that the sugar molecule is bound within a &beta;-barrel, buried by the N-terminal arm of the protein. It has been suggested that this N-terminal arm plays a key role in the regulation of the arabinose-dependent DNA-binding properties of the protein. In the absence of arabinose it interacts with the DNA-binding domain and constrains this domain, and it releases it in the presence of arabinose |CITS:[9103202][18561170]|. This interaction appears to be affected by a mutation in the interdomain linker |CITS: [21840981]|. On the other hand, the function of AraC is largely unaffected by several other mutations in the interdomain linker |CITS:[26800223]|",
