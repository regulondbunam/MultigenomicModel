YmgA and AriR activate production of the biofilm matrix substance colanic acid as well as acid resistance genes and the biofilm-associated <i>bdm</i> gene and they downregulate adhesive curli fimbriae |CITS:[17222132][17609140][17765265][19172264]|. YcgZ appears to counteract the activities of YmgA and YmgB |CITS:[19240136]|.<br>Expression of this operon is under the control of &sigma;<sup>38</sup> (rpoS) RNA polymerase and  repressed by <i>ycgE</i>, which is transcribed divergently on the opposite strand |CITS:[19240136][ 15716429]|.<br>",
